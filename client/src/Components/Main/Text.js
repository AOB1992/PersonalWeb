I am a Fullstack Developer with a sales and entreprenurial background.
I also have great passion for languages: I speak English, Spanish and French and I translate Latin.
I started my work
career as a professional insurance salesman at a very important company in Argentina. 
There I read the classic sales authors and I mastered the art. Later on I deared and
started my own fintech company. Then I understood the importance of the IT department, wich
in my case was outsourced. I then realized that I wanted my own, I wanted to know and
to control every IT aspect of my company and not to rely on others in order to 
achieve my goals.
Years later pandemic came in and suddenly I found the time to dive myself in this world
and make my first bootcamp at Soy Henry. That was one of my best decisions ever, and the
rest is history...
I aim to deliver for the employer-client. Once I accept a task I fully commit. I believe in
keeping my word. That is my trademark. My goal is to bring world class service to 
web development sphere. Employers deserve an employee whick is fully commited, ready to
work, available to answer the phone at any time, and willing to explain everything
into full detail.
The purpouse of this page is to promote myself in an original way to comunicate myself
in a more assertive way. I hope to show you my capabilities as much as possible via this website.
I consider a good practice to make the front-end of a proyect a mere shower of 
information, and leave the most of the funcionalities to the back-end or server.
In my portfolio (symbol/link) I show a few examples about this.
I thank you for your visit and I hope you find what your are looking for.`
